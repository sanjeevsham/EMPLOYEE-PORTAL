**Description:-**

       Employee management is the effort to help employees do their best work each day in order to achieve the larger goals of the organization. There are many tasks and duties that fall under employee management, but almost all of them can fit into one of some basic categories listed below :

1.Selection:-
       Selection entails finding and hiring the right candidates to fill open positions to keep teams and departments running smoothly. 
     
2.Monitoring:-
       Monitoring includes the measuring and evaluation of employee performance, also called performance management. 

3.Interaction:-
       Interaction covers the day-to-day exchanges between managers and reports, as well as among peers, to communicate job expectations, company culture, feedback, and more. 

4.Discipline:-
       Finally, discipline describes the measures that managers may take to improve  performance, correct mistakes, and enforce company policies. These measures could be as simple as one-on-one meetings.   
       Effective employee management often hinges on individual managers and their ability to motivate, communicate, and build trust with their reports. The best managers act as coaches for their employees, recognizing the great work theyâ€™re doing now while challenging them to improve.
