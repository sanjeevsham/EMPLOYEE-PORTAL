        An Employee Portal, sometimes known as an HR Portal, is an online
        employee engagement platform that puts a range of HR services at the
        employeeâ€™s fingertips. From providing employees with access to helpful
        HR content and self-service functionality that answers their questions,
        to Live Chat and case tracking, an Employee Portal enhances the employee
        service experience, which increases employee satisfaction and engagement
        levels. It is also a communications and change management tool, enabling
        HR to effectively engage with their employees and support the management
        of change and development within the organization. Additional benefits
        include increased workforce productivity and greater efficiency of HR
        operations.

      <p class="para">
        Successful businesses strive for long-term sustainable profits. An
        Employee Portal is a tool that HR can use to support this objective, by
        improving the employee experience, employee productivity and retaining
        staff.<br /><br /><br />
        In a Forbes article, entitled Promoting Employee Happiness Benefits
        Everyone, evidence suggests happier and more productive employees
        provide superior customer service, helping drive sales and repeat
        business faster than in organizations that do not provide the same
        service.

        â€œWe wanted a great way to interact with our employees, providing them
        with a way to send questions to us. Whether it was transactional
        information or less structured requests, such as Employee Relations,
        security issues, investigations or benefits questions, that are a little
        bit more of a back and forth and less straightforward transactional, we
        wanted a platform that enabled employees to interact with HR.

          These days, it is very important to design an outstanding website that
          would help you stand apart from the rest and stay way in front of your
          competitors, and the simple free website builders where everything is
          decided for you just arenâ€™t going to cut it. When designing a useful
          website, you must understand that visual design does not define the
          success of a site. Alternatively, usability and utility do. The
          user-centric design has become an industry standard for the most
          productive and successful sites. A real web means a better experience
          for everyone.
